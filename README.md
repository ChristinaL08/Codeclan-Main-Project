# Mind Me

## Description:
Mind Me is a memory testing game with four themes to choose from and four difficulty levels. Each difficulty level is assigned a set number of cards with a maximum of 12 cards. The player will have a set number of moves to complete the game. Each card has an image underneath which the player has to find its match. Every time a game starts all the cards are shuffled, making every game unique. The user has a set number of attempts in a game to match a turned card to its pair. If unsuccessful the cards turn back over and the player can try again.
